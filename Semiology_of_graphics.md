# Semiology of Graphics - Diagrams, Networks, Maps

## Chapter 1

### The Analisis of Information

##### What is graphic identification?
It is the narrative content (information) for describe the scales variables.

##### What are the two considerations to design on the identification of a graph?
The font type and font size.

##### What it refers to the term of "the number of components" on a graphics?
It describes all common topological properties that a graph could has on it.

##### When a component is ordered?
It is only ordered when its categories are ordered in a single and universal manner and when its categories are defined as equidistant.

### The Properties of the graphic system

##### What do graphics designers are in the graphic system?
They are the visual variables who will form the world of images.

##### What is the boundary between two areas?
A line.

##### What is useful when someone is seeking to equalize a variation and to group correspondences with "all" categories of a variation?
Associative perception.

##### When a value is not quantitative?
When all variables can't be measure or counting.

##### What is the best color scale for a graphic?
Grey scale.

##### What produce a flat?
A color variation without value variation.

## The rules of the graphic system

#### The basic graphic problem.

##### What is a retinal variable?
They are the variation of size, value, texture, color, orientation, shape, or by a combination of several of these variables.

##### Why Chartmaps display bar and pie chart over the features?
Make it possible to symbolize multiple attributes.

##### Why chartmaps are an inefficient type of graph?
Since they require the use of retinal variable in order to differentiate the nongeographic categories.

##### What represents the cartographic visualization?
Acknowledge all relationship of numbers to a geographic area.

#### Image theory

##### What term stablish the standard differentiation between two planar system of identification?
Orthogonal differentiation.

##### Which are the three levels of reading?
Elementary level, intermediate level, and overall level.

##### Why external identification relies on the recognition of retinal variables and quantitative characteristics?
Since it develops a functional management of the variables.

##### When a reader is ready to perceive a serie of pertinent correspondences?
When it identifies the words and arrengement of the components.

##### Which are the most efficient constructions?
Those ones that can perceive on any level by using a single image.

##### Based on the use of retinal variables, What type of variables make an image?
Three homogenous and ordered variables: two planar dimesions, and an ordered retinal variable.

#### Three functions of graphic representation

##### Why a representation must be comprehensive?
To avoid any prior reduction of information and classings are possible and easy.

##### In diagrams, what are the three stages that a reader can retain the simplest image?
Top, middle, and bottom.

##### What characterized an ordered component?
Stability.

##### What are the two properties of a representation?
It must be memorizable and comprenhensive.

#### General rules of construction

##### What is a map?
A single image with information having at most two components

##### According to the standard schema, what is the maximum number of components for a network in a comprehensive image?
2 components

##### What are the needs for a map with two components?
Utilize an ordered retinal variable for representing an additional component at the appropriate level of organization.

##### Which are the two characteristics that depend to develop a standard schema?
The imposition and the number of components.

##### What is the purpose of the standard schemas?
Stablish the constrain data to categories or concepts. 

### General rules of legibility (or rules of separation)

##### Why are standard constructions necessary? or Why are standard constructions needed?
Make possible the reading in any level, but doesn't imply that the image is legible.

##### What is the importance of legibility?
Choose the right font color for an image to emphasize the meaning of the data.

##### Why a high density value is inoperable?
Doesn't proof the accurate of data signs.

##### What is the optimal stage for angle legibility?
70 degrees

##### When is a combination redundant?
When several variables are merge only to represent only a single component.
